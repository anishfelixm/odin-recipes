# odin-recipes

A HTML website containing an index for few recipes. With this project I wanna show that I have learnt the basic HTML elements and gotten a hold at using them. The creation of a working webpage shows that I have learnt to write HTML boilerplate correctly. The index shows I have learnt to use anchor elements, list elements and paragraph elements.
